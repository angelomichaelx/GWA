# GWA
## The student with the highest GWA is identified by this Python code, which reads a file containing a list of students and their GPAs. Their name is then displayed. The GWA of each student is compared to the highest GPA currently in effect, and any necessary variable updates are made by looping through each line in the file. The name of the student with the highest GWA is then printed, along with their corresponding grades.
